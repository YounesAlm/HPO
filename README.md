# HPO
I am trying to find the best combination of hyperparameters in a given set 

Basicaly it is a brute force search so very weak
I am planing on trying to search if i can reduce the combination and test the method of various datasets. 

For now on the example is very simple, it is a binary combination of 10 digits, if the fourth and the sixth of the first and the second digits are equal to one so the tenth will be. 
I should test it on mnist dataset
